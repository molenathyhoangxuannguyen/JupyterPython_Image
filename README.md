# JupyterPython_Image

This is a CNN project called "Shapes_Assistant". It is a program generating random shapes (with or without noise), and exporting .png or .jpeg files. This program also includes a Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN), which is a Deep Learning algorithm, and it takes input as images of shapes (from triangles up to decagons) then categorizes the images into the correct labels (of the shapes).
